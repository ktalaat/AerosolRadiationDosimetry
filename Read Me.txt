It is assumed that you have already obtained the VIP-Man phantom from RSICC. VIP-Man is developed by Xu et al. Health Phys (2000) and is not included. You will also need a co-registered lung model for CFPD simulations. 

The scripts were developed for specific cases/models but may serve as a template for similar work.
